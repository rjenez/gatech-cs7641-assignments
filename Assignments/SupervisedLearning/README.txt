README.txt - Assignment1

This file contains a brief introduction as to how to run the jupyter notebooks for data analysis, training, and testing for 
the analysis of the five models and two datasets.
The location for all of this assignment is in my github repo (https://github.com/rjenez/gatech-cs7641-assignments) under Assignments/SupervisedLearning. I have
made a shareable link through gitfront.io (https://gitfront.io/r/ricardojenez/gkJn5KrwThuB/gatech-cs7641-assignments/tree/Assignments/SupervisedLearning/).

First we need to download the datasets:
The airline dataset from Kaggle:
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/download?datasetVersionNumber=1"
The diabetes dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset
Then we unzip the archives of these files.

There three main files for this project:
Assignment1-DataAnalysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that reads the data files, does EDA, and outputs cleaned and targeted datasets for the Training phase.
Assignment1-Training.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that reads the training files generated by Assignment1-DataAnalysis.ipynb and does some analysis 
                             then uses mainly a RandomSearchCV to try and identify a few different hyperparameters that could improve the models performance.
                             Some amount of work was put in show different analysis highlight the tuning steps for these models.
Assignment1-Testing.ipynb - The final testing of the datasets with respect to the tuned models and evaluating the different model performances on the two datasets.

In order to run these files we must have jupyter notebook setup and an environment that has all the following
python modulse loaded:
pandas            - Pandas library for data manipulation
numpy             - Numpy library for data manipulation
scikit-learn      - Scikit Learn library for all the model creation and tuning
imbalanced-learn  - Imbalanced dataset sampling
seaborn           - Seaborn for visualization and plotting
matplotlib        - Matplotlib for visualization and plotting
plotly            - Plotly for visualization and plotting
pickle            - Pickle for saving models
graphviz          - Graph visualization - used to see some of the decision tree information for airlines

The steps to running this model is to extract the data from the zip files and move them to a Data directory with
the following structure (or just modify the first line for location of the files in the Assignment1-DataAnalysis.ipynb)
file.
The variables that need to be changed are those below (note the airline dataset has a train.csv and test.csv set already,
while the diabetes dataset has multiple files and I have decided to use the main one diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv): 
airline_dataset_file_train = '../../Data/AirlinePassengerSatisfaction/train.csv'
airline_dataset_file_test = '../../Data/AirlinePassengerSatisfaction/test.csv'
diabetes_dataset_file = '../../Data/DiabetesHealthIndicatorDataset/diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv'

Once you have these variables set in Assignment1-DataAnalysis.ipynb, you may run the file to conclusion
and it will generate the train/test sets for each of the datasets that will be used by
Assignment1-Training.ipynb. 
You can just load this notebook in and run it from the begining (and wait a while...) and it will
generate all the graphs and analysis and training that I ended up with at the end that I used
in my report.

The final notebook is Assignment1-Testing.ipynb which you can run from the beginning with
no change that runs the final test holdout datasets to show the performance of the
models on these datasets.
